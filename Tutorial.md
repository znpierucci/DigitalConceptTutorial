## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Name it whatever you want
2. Initialize the respository with a README 
3. Add a .gitignore with a tag of "Swift"

## Step 2: Edit .gitignore

When dealing with Swift, every project has .DS_Store files that must be ignored, which is why we put ".DS_Store" in the ".gitignore" file.

1. Open your .gitignore file and click the pencil to edit it
2. Type ".DS_Store" on line 24 of the .gitignore file
3. Commit the file

## Step 3: Locate Your Xcode Project Folder

If you have not already created an Xcode project, [click here to learn how](https://github.com/znpierucci/DigitalConceptTutorial/blob/master/XcodeTutorial.md).

My Project folder is found in my desktop:

## Step 5: Locate Your Project Directory Using Terminal

To change directories, you must type in "cd" followed by the name of the folder or location you are looking to change into.

For example, if you would like to switch to your desktop, you must type in "cd Desktop"

To change into your project folder, locate the path of the project folder, and cd into the location, then cd into the project folder.

For example, if your project folder is on your desktop, do the following:

1. Type "cd Desktop" and press enter
2. Type "cd HelloWorldExample" (or whatever your project is named) and press enter
3. Type "ls" and press enter to see all of your files

You are now inside your Project Directory!

## Step 6: Connect GitHub to your Project

1. Type the following commands in order in Terminal!
>git init

>git add .

>git commit -m "First commit"

2. Copy the url of your GitHub repository by clicking the green "Clone or download" button on your repository home page and then clicking the clipboard symbol to copy it to your clipboard

3. Type the following command in terminal, replacing the word "url" with the URL of your GitHub repository
>git remote add origin url 
4. Type the following commands in order in Terminal!
>git pull --rebase origin master

>git rm -r --cached .

>git add .

>git commit -m "Applied .gitignore"

>git push -u origin master
