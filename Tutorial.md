## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Name it whatever you want
2. Initialize the respository with a README 
3. Add a .gitignore with a tag of "Swift"

## Step 2: Edit .gitignore

When dealing with Swift, every project has .DS_Store files that must be ignored, which is why we put ".DS_Store" in the ".gitignore" file.

1. Open your .gitignore file and click the pencil to edit it
2. Type ".DS_Store" on line 24 of the .gitignore file
3. Commit the file
